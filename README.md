## Usage

There are 2 utilities comprising miniWeb:

  1. **Inspect**. Allows you to dump requests from HTTP clients to console. It
     is useful for debugging clients as not all of them have builtin facilities
     to examine the data they are sending/receiving.

  2. **Serve**. Serves the contents of chosen directory over HTTP.
